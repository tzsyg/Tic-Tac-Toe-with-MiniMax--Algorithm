## MiniMax Algorithm
The min max algorithm in AI, commonly referred to as minimax, is a backtracking algorithm used in decision-making, game theory and artificial intelligence (AI). It is used to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that the opponent also plays optimally.

The algorithm will check all possibilities for the player and for the opponent and return the most optimal way to win or prevent the opponent from winning.
